DEBUG version 0.98.

This is a partially implemented clone of the MS-DOS DEBUG command.
See the documentation file (debug.doc) for a list of what has yet to
be implemented.  Pretty much all the functionality of DOS 2.1 is in there,
though.

The files in this distribution are:

	debug.com	The executable binary.
	debug.doc	Detailed documentation file.
	debug.asm	Assembler source code for DEBUG.  Assemble with nasm.
	instr.*		Data files on the instruction set.
	mktables.c	C program to compile the internal instruction-set
			tables into the source file debug.asm.  It runs under
			Linux or Turbo C (version 2.0, at least).
	readme		This file.

This program is copyrighted, but feel free to distribute and use it
as you wish.  For full copyright conditions, see the file debug.asm.
