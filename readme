DEBUG version 0.99g.

This is a partially implemented clone of the MS-DOS DEBUG command.
See the documentation file (debug.doc) for a list of what has yet to
be implemented.  Pretty much all the functionality of DOS 2.1 is in there,
though.

The files in this distribution are:

	debug.com	The executable binary.
	debug.doc	Detailed documentation file.
	debug.asm	Assembler source code for DEBUG.  Assemble with nasm.
	debugtbl.inc	include file for debug.asm, generated by mktables
	instr.*		Data files on the instruction set.
	mktables.c	C program to compile the internal instruction-set
			tables into source file debugtbl.inc. It runs under
			Linux or Turbo C (version 2.0, at least). 
                        Open Watcom v1.5 WCC works as well.
	readme		This file.

This program is copyrighted, but feel free to distribute and use it
as you wish.  For full copyright conditions, see the file debug.asm.
