DEBUG version 1.02.

This is a clone of the MS-DOS DEBUG command. Some minor things aren't
implemented (for details see file debug.doc). OTOH it has many features
not available in the original DEBUG.

The files in this distribution are:

	debug.com	The executable binary.
	debugx.com	A DPMI aware version of debug.
	debug.doc	Detailed documentation file.
	debug.asm	Assembler source code for DEBUG.  Assemble with nasm.
	debugtbl.inc	include file for debug.asm, generated by mktables
	instr.*		Data files on the instruction set.
	mktables.c	C program to compile the internal instruction-set
			tables into source file debugtbl.inc. It runs under
			Linux or Turbo C (version 2.0, at least). 
			Open Watcom v1.5 WCC works as well.
	readme		This file.
	SAMPLES		contains samples for 16 and 32-bit DPMI clients.

This program is copyrighted, but feel free to distribute and use it
as you wish.  For full copyright conditions, see the file debug.asm.
