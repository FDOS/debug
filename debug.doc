This is a clone of the DOS DEBUG command.

The following are not implemented:

	Decent documentation
	Loading of .HEX files.

This debugger extends the DOS version in the following ways:

   o	You can do `r cx 1234' instead of having to put the `1234' on a
	separate line.

   o	The assembler and disassembler support all publicly documented
	instructions for Intel chips through the Pentium Pro (P6), except for
	the MMX instructions.  The assembler and disassembler inform you if
	any instruction is inappropriate for the current processor.

   o	The current processor (for the purposes of assembler and disassembler
	warnings, above) can be declared to be something else via the following
	commands:

		m0	Declare current processor to be an 8088
		m1	Declare 80186
		m2	Declare 286
		m3	Declare 386
		m4	Declare 486
		m5	Declare Pentium
		m6	Declare Pentium Pro
		mc	Declare the existence of a math coprocessor
		mnc	Declare the absence of a math coprocessor
		mc2	Declare that the math coprocessor is a 287 (only valid
			if the current processor is a 386)
		m?	Print currently declared processor type

   o	When doing `debug < file', debug will not hang if it reaches an end of
	file before encountering a `q' command.

   o	This debugger saves and restores the program's Control-C and critical
	error interrupts, providing for better isolation between the debugger
	and the program being debugged.
