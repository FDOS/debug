This is a clone of the DOS DEBUG command.

The following are not implemented:

	Decent documentation
	Loading of .HEX files.

This debugger extends the DOS version in the following ways:

   o	You can do `r cx 1234' instead of having to put the `1234' on a
	separate line.

   o	The assembler and disassembler support all publicly documented
	instructions for Intel chips through the Pentium Pro (P6), except for
	the MMX instructions.  The assembler and disassembler inform you if
	any instruction is inappropriate for the current processor.
    
   o    FPU Opcodes are also supported. To specify size of memory operands
	use "FLOAT" or "DOUBLE". "REAL4", "REAL8", "DWORD" or "QWORD" won't be
	accepted in this context.

   o	The current processor (for the purposes of assembler and disassembler
	warnings, above) can be declared to be something else via the following
	commands:

		m0	Declare current processor to be an 8088
		m1	Declare 80186
		m2	Declare 286
		m3	Declare 386
		m4	Declare 486
		m5	Declare Pentium
		m6	Declare Pentium Pro
		mc	Declare the existence of a math coprocessor
		mnc	Declare the absence of a math coprocessor
		mc2	Declare that the math coprocessor is a 287 (only valid
			if the current processor is a 386)
		m?	Print currently declared processor type

   o	When doing `debug < file', debug will not hang if it reaches an end of
	file before encountering a `q' command.

   o	This debugger saves and restores the program's Control-C and critical
	error interrupts, providing for better isolation between the debugger
	and the program being debugged.

   o	'r register [value]' accepts 32-bit register names (for cpu 80386+).
   o	'rn' displays FPU register status (currently for cpu 80386+ only).
   o	'rx' switches among 8086 and 80386 register display (for cpu 80386+).
   
   o	'tm 0|1' sets trace command mode, 0 = process INTs (default),
	1 = single-step INTs (the MS-DOS debug compatible mode).
        
   o	'xr' allows to reallocate an EMS handle and 'xa' allows to allocate
	an "empty" EMS handle (with zero pages) - but only if an EMM v4.0
	is present.  
   o	Besides 'i' and 'o' exist the variations 'iw', 'id', 'ow' and 'od'
	to read/write a WORD or DWORD value from/to a port. DWORD values
	require a 80386+ cpu.

   o	'h' can handle dword values.

   o	A DPMI aware version of the debugger, DEBUGX, is available. It can
	debug real-mode applications and both 16-bit and 32-bit DPMI clients.
	To debug DPMI clients a DPMI host has be be installed *before* the
	debugger is launched, it won't work if the application to debug
	installs its own host during the debug process. Tested with cwsdpmi,
	hdpmi, WinXP NTVDM, 32rtm. In DosEmu and Windows 95/98/ME DOS boxes 
	it is required to single-step through the initial switch to
	protected-mode, else DEBUGX will loose control of the debuggee.

   o	register names can be used anywhere where a number is expected as
	input. That is, things like "u cs:ip" do work.
